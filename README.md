Hi there! Welcome to the Introduction to Cyber Security Course @ JCT!

Your VM environment should contain everything you need for the labs. 

To start using it, run in the terminal
`./startup.sh`

If somehow things are not working, reinstall the prerequisites by 
running the following in your bash command line:
`./setup.sh`
